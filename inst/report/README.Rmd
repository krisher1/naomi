### Naomi output file directory

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## Set dir to params$output_dir and then print tree relative to this
## fs::dir_tree uses the path arg as the text for the first node
## but this will be the path at time of generation i.e. the path
## to the dir on the server, not the path relative to output zip which
## the user will be looking at. So print relative path "." to avoid
## including confusing path as top level node
withr::with_dir(params$output_dir, fs::dir_tree("."))
```

The following files have been generated as part of a Naomi model fit:

**fit**: 

  * calibration_options.yml: Specifications for calibration of Naomi estimates to Spectrum totals.
  * data_options.yml: Specifications for inclusion of model inputs.
  * model_options.yml: Specfications for model fit parameters.
  * spectrum_calibration: Tabular dataset of calibrated and an uncalibrated model outputs.
  
**info**:

  * unaids_navigator_checklist: Navigator checklist.
  * model_options.yml: Full model options (including advanced options).


Files containing naomi model outputs:
